## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, we are using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out the model on images of German traffic signs that we find on the web.

A convolutional neural networks (CNN) might have several layers, and each layer might capture a different level in the hierarchy of objects. The first layer is the lowest level in the hierarchy, where the CNN generally classifies small parts of the image into simple shapes like horizontal and vertical lines and simple blobs of colors. The subsequent layers tend to be higher levels in the hierarchy and generally classify more complex ideas like shapes (combinations of lines), and eventually classifies the image by combining the larger, more complex objects. The CNN learns all of this on its own


### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)


### Dataset

1. Download the dataset. You can download the pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32 [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d53ce_traffic-sign-data/traffic-sign-data.zip).

2. Clone the project and start the notebook.
```
git clone https://github.com/shmulik-willinger/traffic_sign_classifier
cd traffic-signs
jupyter notebook traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
```
3. Follow the instructions in the `traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb` notebook.
